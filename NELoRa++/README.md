# SenSys2021-NELoRa

This repository provides the codes for our SenSys 2021 paper

This repository contains scripts and instructions for reproducing the experiments in our SenSys '21 paper "[NELoRa: Towards Ultra-low SNR LoRa Communication with Neural-enhanced Demodulation](https://cse.msu.edu/~caozc/papers/sensys21-li.pdf)".

If you have any questions or comments, please post in the Issues on Github.

**NELoRa won the Best Paper Award at SenSys '21!**

**This repo is actively maintained currently.**

Illustrated in the following figure, our repo is composed of two modules, including the Symbol Generation and the neural-enhanced demodulation.
