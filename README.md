# NELoRa++
Pushing Even Lower-SNR Neural-Demodulation of LoRa Communication

## Introduction
+ Replicate the NELoRa paper on the dechirp model with Matlab and neural enhanced decoding model with Pytorch.
+ We implement parameter pruning to compress the NELoRa model by 60% and lower the SNR threshold by 0.4dB.
+ ML System (Model Compression, LoRa, PyTorch)
